        <h2 id = 'quote'><i>“Friendship is the hardest thing in the world to explain. 
            It’s not something you learn in school. But if you haven’t learned the meaning 
            of friendship, you really haven’t learned anything.” </i></h2>
        
        <p>Friendship, a state of enduring affection, esteem, intimacy, and trust between 
            two people. In all cultures, friendships are important relationships throughout 
            a person’s life span.</p>
        <p>
            Friendship is generally characterized by five defining features:
        <ol class = 'points'>
            <li>It is a dyadic relationship, meaning that it involves a series of interactions between two individuals known to each other.</li>
            <li>It is recognized by both members of the relationship and is characterized by a bond or tie of reciprocated affection.</li>
            <li>It is not obligatory; two individuals choose to form a friendship with each other. In Western societies, friendships are one 
                of the least prescribed close relationships, with no formal duties or legal obligations to one another.</li>
            <li>It is typically egalitarian in nature. Unlike parent-child relationships, for instance, each individual in a friendship has about the same amount of power or authority in the relationship.</li>
            <li>It is almost always characterized by companionship and shared activities. In fact, one of the primary goals and motivations of friendship is companionship.</li>
        </ol>
